## 🔧 Issues Fixed Today

### Issue 1: Audio Engine Initialization ✅
**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'volume')`

**Root Cause**: AudioContext not initialized before use

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced audio engine initialization with try-catch
- Added proper error handling
- Added null checks before using audioContext

**Files Modified**: `lib/audioEngine.ts`, `components/NeuroFlowDashboard.tsx`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 2: Mode Mapping ✅
**Error**: `Error: No config found for mode: "focus"`

**Root Cause**: Dashboard uses user modes ('focus', 'calm', 'energize') but audio engine expects brain wave names ('delta', 'theta', 'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma')

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `mapModeToFrequency()` to audio engine
- Added `modeToFrequency()` helper to dashboard
- Maps user modes to brain wave frequencies

**Files Modified**: `lib/audioEngine.ts`, `components/NeuroFlowDashboard.tsx`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## 🎯 Mode Mapping Reference

### User Modes → Brain Wave Frequencies
```
Focus    → Gamma (40 Hz)   - Peak focus, deep work
Calm     → Alpha (10 Hz)   - Relaxed alertness, stress relief
Energize → Beta (20 Hz)    - Active thinking, productivity
```

### Brain Wave Details
```
Delta   (0.5-4 Hz)   - Deep sleep, subconscious
Theta   (4-8 Hz)     - Creativity, meditation
Alpha   (8-12 Hz)    - Relaxed focus, learning
Beta    (12-30 Hz)   - Active thinking, productivity
Gamma   (30-100 Hz)  - Peak focus, cognitive processing
```

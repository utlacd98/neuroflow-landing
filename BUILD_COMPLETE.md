## 🧬 Neuroscience Implementation

### Brain Wave Frequencies

| Mode | Frequency | Research | Effect |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Focus | 40 Hz | Gamma waves | Enhanced attention, problem-solving |
| Calm | 10 Hz | Alpha waves | Relaxation, light meditation |
| Energize | 25 Hz | Beta-Gamma | Alertness, memory enhancement |

**Research Sources:**
- NIH: Binaural beats increase attentional concentration
- Brain.fm: Functional music for focus and relaxation
- Neuroscience studies: Brain wave entrainment effects

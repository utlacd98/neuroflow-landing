## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Feature 1: Dynamic Audio Feedback AI
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Users experience felt feedback of their brain's rhythm syncing with the app:
- Reward signals boost frequency during focus peaks
- Calming signals reduce tempo when idle
- Resonance sweeps reinforce stable focus
- Adaptive volume responds to focus level

### Feature 2: Predictive Mode Switching
**Status**: ✅ Complete

App intuitively knows what the user needs next:
- Detects focus drops → suggests Calm Mode
- Detects flow states → suggests Energize Mode
- Detects chaos → nudges to Energize Mode
- Predicts fatigue with time estimates

### Feature 3: Neuro-AI Coaching
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Personalized recommendations based on patterns:
- "You maintained 72% focus stability for 28 minutes"
- "Your rhythm suggests fatigue after 22 minutes"
- "Next time, take a 3-minute reset tone"
- Fine-tuned based on collected data

### Feature 4: Frequency-Mood Mapping
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Real-time visualization of brain state:
- Current frequency display (Hz)
- Brain wave type identification
- Mental state mapping
- Color-coded visualization
- Focus level indicator

### Feature 5: Session Recording & Playback
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Store and replay session waveforms:
- Automatic session recording
- Statistics calculation
- Export/import functionality
- Playback visualization support
- Progress tracking and demos

## 🔧 Integration Points

### With Audio Engine
```typescript
adaptiveController.addFocusMetric(focusLevel);
const config = adaptiveController.calculateAdaptiveConfig(...);
// Apply dynamic adjustments
```

### With Dashboard
```typescript
sessionRecorder.startRecording(mode);
predictiveModeSwitcher.addFocusMetric(metrics.focusLevel);
const suggestion = predictiveModeSwitcher.getSuggestion(mode);
```

### With UI
```typescript
<RealtimeFeedback
  frequency={frequency}
  focusLevel={metrics.focusLevel}
  isPlaying={isPlaying}
  messages={feedbackMessages}
/>
```

---

## 📈 Key Algorithms

### Reward Signal
```
if (focus_surge && focus > 0.75) {
  frequency *= 1.1
  volume *= 1.15
}
```

### Mode Suggestion
```
if (focus_drop > 25% && focus < 0.5) {
  suggest('calm')
} else if (focus > 0.75 && stable) {
  suggest('energize')
}
```

### Fatigue Prediction
```
fatigue = (minutes / 60) + trend + focus_adjustment
if (fatigue >= 0.8) {
  recommend_break()
}
```

activityDetector.onMetricsChange((metrics) => {
  // Add to predictive switcher
  predictiveModeSwitcher.addFocusMetric(metrics.focusLevel);

  // Check for suggestions
  const suggestion = predictiveModeSwitcher.getSuggestion(mode);

  // Add to session recorder
  sessionRecorder.addDataPoint(
    metrics.focusLevel,
    1 - metrics.focusLevel,
    frequency
  );

  // Adapt audio
  audioEngine.adaptToFocusLevel(metrics.focusLevel);

# NeuroFlow - Fixes Applied

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### 1. Audio Engine Static Method Error ✅

**Problem**: 
```
TypeError: _lib_audioEngine__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__.audioEngine.getConfigForMode is not a function
```

**Root Cause**: 
The `getConfigForMode()` method is a static method on the `NeuroFlowAudioEngine` class, but the code was trying to call it on the `audioEngine` instance.

**Solution**:
- Updated `components/NeuroFlowDashboard.tsx` line 10 to import the class:
  ```typescript
  import { audioEngine, NeuroFlowAudioEngine, type AudioConfig } from '@/lib/audioEngine';
  ```
- Updated line 53 to call the static method on the class:
  ```typescript
  const config = NeuroFlowAudioEngine.getConfigForMode(mode);
  ```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

## 🧬 Neuroscience Implementation

### Brain Wave Frequencies

| Mode | Frequency | Brain Wave | Purpose |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Focus | 40 Hz | Gamma | Enhanced attention, problem-solving |
| Calm | 10 Hz | Alpha | Relaxation, light meditation |
| Energize | 25 Hz | Beta-Gamma | Alertness, memory enhancement |

### Research-Backed Design

- Binaural beats proven to increase attentional concentration
- Alpha waves promote relaxation and creativity
- Theta waves enhance emotional processing
- Adaptive audio responds to real-time focus levels

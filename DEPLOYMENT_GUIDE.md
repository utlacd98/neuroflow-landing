## 🧪 Detailed Testing Checklist

### Blink Detection
- [ ] Normal blinking (10-20 blinks/min)
- [ ] Rapid blinking (stress test)
- [ ] Prolonged staring (no false positives)
- [ ] Different lighting conditions
- [ ] Blink rate displayed accurately

### Focus Score
- [ ] Smooth transitions between levels
- [ ] No sudden spikes or drops
- [ ] Responsive to real focus changes
- [ ] Consistent readings over time
- [ ] Accurate 0-100 range

### Audio Quality
- [ ] No static or crackling
- [ ] Smooth frequency transitions
- [ ] No clicking or popping
- [ ] Clean at all volume levels
- [ ] Proper volume control

### Frequency Mapping
- [ ] 0-25: Alpha (8-12 Hz) - Soft ambient
- [ ] 25-50: Beta (13-20 Hz) - Mid-beat
- [ ] 50-75: High Beta (20-30 Hz) - Sharp binaural
- [ ] 75-100: Gamma (30-40 Hz) - Layered harmonic

### Recovery Mode
- [ ] Activates after 2 minutes low focus
- [ ] Smooth fade-in to theta waves
- [ ] Visual indicator shows progress
- [ ] Deactivates when focus recovers
- [ ] Theta frequency (4-8 Hz) correct

### Performance
- [ ] 30 FPS video on desktop
- [ ] 15 FPS analysis (smooth)
- [ ] Low CPU usage (<20%)
- [ ] Mobile device compatibility

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Static Noise in Audio
**Solution**: 
- Check volume level (should be 0.25)
- Verify low-pass filter is active
- Test on different device
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Jittery Focus Score
**Solution**:
- Ensure exponential smoothing is enabled
- Check frame analysis interval (every 2nd frame)
- Verify smoothing factor (α=0.15)
- Test with better lighting

### Issue: Missed Blinks
**Solution**:
- Adjust eye closure threshold (0.2)
- Increase min blink frames (2)
- Check lighting conditions
- Test with different camera

### Issue: High CPU Usage
**Solution**:
- Verify frame skipping is enabled
- Check face region caching
- Reduce canvas resolution
- Close other browser tabs

### Issue: Recovery Mode Not Activating
**Solution**:
- Ensure focus score < 30
- Wait 2+ minutes
- Check recovery mode is enabled
- Verify audio context is active

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Desktop (Chrome DevTools)
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record 30 seconds
4. Check:
   - Frame rate (should be 30 FPS)
   - CPU usage (should be <20%)
   - Memory (should be stable)

### Mobile (Chrome DevTools Remote)
1. Connect phone to computer
2. Open `chrome://inspect`
3. Select device
4. Open DevTools
5. Monitor performance

### Key Metrics
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS (video), 15 FPS (analysis)
- **CPU Usage**: <20%
- **Memory**: <50 MB
- **Battery**: <5% drain per hour

# NeuroFlow - Production Action Plan

## 🎯 Your Mission (If You Choose to Accept It)

Transform NeuroFlow from MVP to production-ready in 3 phases.

---

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Today)**: 15 minutes - API Setup
- **Phase 2 (This Week)**: 2-3 hours - Testing & Optimization
- **Phase 3 (Next Week)**: 2-3 hours - Deployment

**Total**: ~6 hours to production! 🚀

## 🚀 Phase 1: API Setup (15 minutes)

### What You Need to Do

#### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key (5 min)
```
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Copy the key
4. Keep it safe!
```

#### Step 2: Create .env.local (2 min)
```bash
# In project root (Downloads/neuroflow-landing/)
# Create file: .env.local

NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
OPENAI_API_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=150
```

**Replace `sk-your-key-here` with your actual key**

#### Step 3: Restart Dev Server (1 min)
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

#### Step 4: Test It Works (5 min)
```
1. Open http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Start a focus session
3. Type for 1-2 minutes
4. Stop session
5. Check if AI feedback appears
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] API key obtained

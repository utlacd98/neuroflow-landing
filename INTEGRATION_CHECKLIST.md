## 🔧 Integration Phase 1: Core Setup (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Update Audio Engine
- [ ] Open `lib/audioEngine.ts`
- [ ] Import `AdaptiveAudioController` from `lib/adaptiveAudioEngine`
- [ ] Add `private adaptiveController = new AdaptiveAudioController();`
- [ ] Create `adaptToFocusLevel(focusLevel: number)` method
- [ ] Call `adaptiveController.addFocusMetric(focusLevel)`
- [ ] Get adaptive config: `const config = adaptiveController.calculateAdaptiveConfig(...)`
- [ ] Apply frequency and volume adjustments
- [ ] Test audio adaptation

### Step 2: Update Dashboard - Imports
- [ ] Open `components/NeuroFlowDashboard.tsx`
- [ ] Import `RealtimeFeedback` from `@/components/RealtimeFeedback`
- [ ] Import `predictiveModeSwitcher` from `@/lib/predictiveModeSwitcher`
- [ ] Import `neuroCoach` from `@/lib/neuroCoach`
- [ ] Import `sessionRecorder` from `@/lib/sessionRecorder`

### Step 3: Update Dashboard - Session Start
- [ ] In `handlePlayPause()` when starting session:
  - [ ] Call `sessionRecorder.startRecording(mode)`
  - [ ] Initialize predictive switcher
  - [ ] Initialize neuro coach

### Step 4: Update Dashboard - Metrics Tracking
- [ ] In `activityDetector.onMetricsChange()`:
  - [ ] Call `predictiveModeSwitcher.addFocusMetric(newMetrics.focusLevel)`
  - [ ] Call `sessionRecorder.addDataPoint(focus, calm, frequency)`
  - [ ] Call `audioEngine.adaptToFocusLevel(newMetrics.focusLevel)`

### Step 5: Update Dashboard - Session End
- [ ] In `handlePlayPause()` when stopping session:
  - [ ] Call `const session = sessionRecorder.stopRecording()`
  - [ ] Call `const coaching = neuroCoach.generateRecommendations({...})`
  - [ ] Record session pattern: `neuroCoach.recordSession({...})`
  - [ ] Display coaching feedback

### Step 6: Add Real-time Feedback Component
- [ ] Add `<RealtimeFeedback />` component to dashboard
- [ ] Pass `frequency` prop
- [ ] Pass `focusLevel` prop
- [ ] Pass `isPlaying` prop
- [ ] Pass `messages` prop (initialize as empty array)

---

## 🎨 Integration Phase 2: UI Enhancement (1-2 hours)

### Step 7: Add Mode Suggestion UI
- [ ] Create mode suggestion dialog component
- [ ] Show suggestion when `predictiveModeSwitcher.getSuggestion()` returns result
- [ ] Display confidence level
- [ ] Add "Accept" and "Dismiss" buttons
- [ ] Auto-switch or fade based on action type

### Step 8: Add Feedback Messages
- [ ] Create feedback message system
- [ ] Detect focus surges: `adaptiveController.detectFocusSurge()`
- [ ] Detect focus drops: `adaptiveController.detectFocusDrop()`
- [ ] Detect stabilization: `adaptiveController.detectFocusStabilization()`
- [ ] Create message objects with type, message, icon, duration
- [ ] Pass to `RealtimeFeedback` component

### Step 9: Add Coaching Display
- [ ] Create coaching recommendations panel
- [ ] Display summary from `neuroCoach.generateRecommendations()`
- [ ] Show patterns array
- [ ] Show recommendations array
- [ ] Show next session tips
- [ ] Show estimated optimal duration

### Step 10: Add Session Playback
- [ ] Create session playback component
- [ ] Get sessions: `sessionRecorder.getSessions()`
- [ ] Get playback data: `sessionRecorder.getPlaybackData(sessionId)`
- [ ] Create playback visualization
- [ ] Add playback speed control
- [ ] Add session statistics display

---

## 🧪 Integration Phase 3: Testing (2-3 hours)

### Step 11: Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `AdaptiveAudioController` methods
- [ ] Test `PredictiveModeSwitcher` methods
- [ ] Test `NeuroCoach` methods
- [ ] Test `SessionRecorder` methods
- [ ] Test detection algorithms

### Step 12: Integration Tests
- [ ] Test data flow from activity detection to audio engine
- [ ] Test mode suggestion workflow
- [ ] Test session recording and playback
- [ ] Test coaching recommendation generation
- [ ] Test real-time feedback display

### Step 13: E2E Tests
- [ ] Start session and verify recording
- [ ] Simulate focus surge and verify reward signal
- [ ] Simulate focus drop and verify suggestion
- [ ] End session and verify coaching
- [ ] Verify all UI updates correctly

### Step 14: Performance Testing
- [ ] Profile memory usage
- [ ] Check CPU usage during calculations
- [ ] Verify localStorage performance
- [ ] Test with 50 sessions stored
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

---

## 🚀 Integration Phase 4: Deployment (1 hour)

### Step 15: Final Review
- [ ] Code review all changes
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Check responsive design
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

### Step 16: Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Add feature screenshots
- [ ] Document new APIs
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

### Step 17: Deployment
- [ ] Build production bundle
- [ ] Test production build
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Final testing on staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Step 18: Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Fix any issues
- [ ] Plan next iteration

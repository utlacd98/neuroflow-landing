---

## What You Got

### ✅ 4 Complete AI Systems (1,080 lines of TypeScript)

#### 1. Focus Pattern Learner
**File**: `lib/focusPatternLearner.ts` (220 lines)

Learns your personal concentration rhythm and predicts focus dips:
- Time-of-day analysis (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Focus pattern tracking by day of week
- Predictive focus dip detection
- Personalized frequency recommendations
- Peak hours and low-energy time identification
- Learning confidence scoring

**Example**: "You tend to lose focus after 22 minutes. Switching to a 10 Hz Alpha blend might stabilize attention."

---

#### 2. Gamification Engine
**File**: `lib/gamificationEngine.ts` (280 lines)

Motivates users with XP, badges, and streaks:
- XP system (10 XP/min + focus bonus)
- Level progression (1000 XP per level)
- 8 unique badges (Zen Master, Focus Forge, Brainwave Rider, etc.)
- Daily/weekly streak tracking
- Achievement system
- Motivational messages

**Example**: "7 days in a row of Flow Mode — your neural rhythm is evolving!"

---

#### 3. AI Insights Engine
**File**: `lib/aiInsightsEngine.ts` (300 lines)

Provides personalized coaching and progress tracking:
- Session narrative generation
- Mental state journey analysis
- Key insights extraction
- Personalized recommendations
- Weekly/monthly progress metrics
- Trend analysis (improving/declining/stable)
- Goal creation and tracking

**Example**: "You began in mild distraction, stabilized after 6 min, and maintained Gamma focus for 18 min — excellent neuro-resilience."

---

#### 4. Audio Fusion Engine
**File**: `lib/audioFusionEngine.ts` (280 lines)

Blends multiple sound types and adapts to environment:
- Multi-layer audio blending (binaural + ambient + instrumental + nature)
- Environment noise detection via microphone
- Adaptive audio complexity
- Frequency personalization
- Playlist management
- Save favorite "states"

**Example**: Quiet office → softer harmonics; Noisy space → stronger carrier frequency
